Other remarks
1. Your slides will be shared among all the students in this class.

2. At the last page of your slides each time you must add
-summary of what you have modified from previous year slides (see 3. below)
-photos, with time-stamps, of your group meeting(s) as a proof that you get together on Zoom, etc., and seriously discuss or rehearse each other before the real presentations. As a result, precaution should be done to make sure that those photos will not violate your privacy while they can be used  as the said proof.

3. For your reference, please find slides in the previous years (2017-2020) from:
https://ritsumei365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ruck_is_ritsumei_ac_jp/Ejzxrg15spNCudM4oMxJpBYBpn7qE_ROfqM72J9j55liqA?e=xyAkoQ

Please note that there were different group numbers in those years, but you should be able to readily locate the files you want. You are welcome to reuse and improve them, namely, making them easier to understand by adding clearer explanations, more figures, animations, video clips, etc. When the information in the textbook is difficult to understand, please do internet search and reflect the knowledge you find into your slides, accordingly.
